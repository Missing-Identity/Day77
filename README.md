# Computation with NumPy and N-Dimensional Arrays

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores the computational capabilities of NumPy, particularly focusing on operations with N-dimensional arrays.

## Overview

The notebook provides a deep dive into the world of array-based computing with NumPy. It includes demonstrations of creating arrays, performing complex computations, and leveraging the power of N-dimensional array structures for data analysis. The notebook also includes practical examples of using NumPy for data manipulation and analysis. All the resources used in the notebook are taken from Angela Yu's [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-analysis-with-python-pandas/) course on Udemy.

## Features

- Introduction to NumPy array creation and attributes.
- Techniques for array indexing, slicing, and iterating.
- Advanced operations with arrays including broadcasting and vectorization.
- Practical examples of NumPy in data manipulation and analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy library

## Usage

To run this notebook:

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, or use Jupyter Lab.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter and run each cell sequentially to understand the computation steps with NumPy.
